# AI-Powered-Customer-Support-Chatbot

### Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop an AI-powered customer support chatbot. This chatbot will assist in answering customer queries, handling complaints, and providing information about products and services. It will leverage natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand and respond to user inputs in a conversational manner, offering real-time assistance.

### Objectives
###### Data Collection: Gather and preprocess customer service chat logs and FAQs.
###### Model Development: Train NLP models for intent recognition and response generation.
###### Integration: Develop an interactive chatbot that integrates with the backend system for dynamic responses.
###### Deployment: Deploy the chatbot as a web service.
###### User Interface: Create a web-based chat interface for users to interact with the chatbot.
### Tools and Technologies
###### Programming Language: Python
###### Libraries: TensorFlow/Keras, Hugging Face Transformers, Flask/Django
###### Data Sources: Synthetic chat logs, publicly available datasets
###### Deployment: Flask/Django for creating a web service, Docker for containerization
###### User Interface: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React or similar frontend framework
### Data Collection
We'll use synthetic data for demonstration purposes. In real-world applications, this data would come from customer service chat logs and FAQs.
